## React 是什麼？
React 是一個陳述式、高效且具有彈性的 JavaScript 函式庫，用以建立使用者介面。它讓你使用小巧而獨立的「component」，來建立複雜的 UI。

## 從概念開始

Modern JavaScript in React Documentation

If you haven’t worked with JavaScript in the last few years, these three points should give you enough knowledge to feel comfortable reading the React documentation:

* We define variables with [`let`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/let) and [`const`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/const) statements. For the purposes of the React documentation, you can consider them equivalent to [`var`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/var).
* We use the `class` keyword to define [JavaScript classes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes). There are two things worth remembering about them. Firstly, unlike with objects, you *don't* need to put commas between class method definitions. Secondly, unlike many other languages with classes, in JavaScript the value of `this` in a method [depends on how it is called](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes#Boxing_with_prototype_and_static_methods).
* We sometimes use `=>` to define ["arrow functions"](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions). They're like regular functions, but shorter. For example, `x => x * 2` is roughly equivalent to `function(x) { return x * 2; }`. Importantly, arrow functions [don't have their own `this` value](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions#No_separate_this) so they're handy when you want to preserve the `this` value from an outer method definition.

**Don't worry if this is too much to take in at once. The [MDN JavaScript Reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) is a stellar resource, and you can consult it whenever you get confused by something.**

Also, when you feel unsure about what some newer syntax means, you can use the [Babel REPL with the ES2015 preset](http://babeljs.io/repl/#?babili=false&browsers=&build=&builtIns=false&code_lz=MYewdgzgLgBAllApgWwjAvDA2gRgDQwBMBAzALoDcAUKJLACYgCuARgDaL0bxKoB0yAIYAHABQAPDAD4YkgFREAlBSA&debug=false&forceAllTransforms=false&shippedProposals=false&circleciRepo=&evaluate=false&fileSize=false&lineWrap=true&presets=es2015%2Creact%2Cstage-1%2Cstage-2%2Cstage-3&prettier=true&targets=Node-6.12&version=6.26.0&envVersion=) to check what equivalent older syntax it compiles to.
